    <h1>Global Warming Overview</h1>

    <p>
        Global warming is the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, causing a gradual rise in temperature with significant environmental consequences.

        Key points about global warming include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Driven by fossil fuel burning, deforestation, and industrial processes.</li>
        <li>Consequences: heatwaves, ice cap melting, rising sea levels, extreme weather, and ecosystem disruptions.</li>
        <li>Threats to biodiversity, food security, and human health.</li>
        <li>Mitigation involves reducing emissions, transitioning to renewables, and adopting sustainable practices.</li>
        <li>Adaptation measures are essential to cope with ongoing changes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        International efforts like the Paris Agreement aim to limit global temperature rise.

    <h2>Causes of Global Warming</h2>
    <p>
        Primary causes are fossil fuel burning, deforestation, industrial processes, agriculture, and waste management.
    </p>

    <h2>Effects of Global Warming</h2>
    <p>
        Effects include rising temperatures, heatwaves, ice cap melting, sea level rise, intense storms, and threats to biodiversity.
